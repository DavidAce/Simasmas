# December 2nd, 2024: Johan Carlström

On Monday, December 2nd, 2024 from 11 am to 12 am we will host a seminar by **Johan Carlström** from **Stockholm University**. 

## Title

Kinetic magnetism as a mediator of strong inter-carrier attraction in moiré flat bands


## Abstract 

The doped Mott insulator, where charge carriers propagate against a spin background, serves as a paradigmatic model for strongly correlated electronic systems. In this framework, two fundamental energy scales emerge: the kinetic energy, stemming from the delocalisation of charge carriers, and the magnetic energy, driven by super-exchange processes that promote antiferromagnetic order. When the onsite repulsion is strong, super-exchange is suppressed, and spin correlations are predominantly governed by delocalisation—a phenomenon known as kinetic magnetism.
In this talk, I will provide a concise introduction to this captivating topic, highlighting recent experimental advances, including those involving moiré materials. I will also discuss my own research, which investigates how kinetic magnetism can mediate attraction between charge carriers, and I will relate these findings to recent experimental observations.
